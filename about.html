           Why do you have to sit at home to get bored when you can visit many nice places in the town

       <p class="text">
        Oslo, is an exciting and beautiful city with views over the Oslo Fjord and mountains surrounding it. 
        Despite its fairly compact size, Oslo has lots to offer and provides the perfect setting for both exploring and relaxing.
        Oslo has something to offer all its visitors, whether you are traveling by yourself, with the whole family or as a couple. 
        There are plenty of cool bars, fun museums and outdoor activities to satisfy everyone. Oslo itself is a mix of families, 
        students and professionals who all come together to enjoy the city. So, however you are traveling, you will fit right in. 
        I would recommend you three places that are close to each other that you can visit in Oslo. 
        The three places are Bjørvika Library, Operahuset and Akkerbrygget.
         You can read more about these places under the map here. 
         The map streams at the Oslo Opera house, but just zoom in or out to find the places you want to see.

                <h2>Oper House</h2>
                <p>The Opera House is the main stage for the Norwegian Opera & Ballet. 
                    You can enter the Opera. The ticket window and the Opera shop are open until 16, 
                    and you can enjoy yourself both inside and out at Sanguine Brasserie. 
                    There are daily guided tours where you visit the Main Stage, 
                    and are told about everything that happens behind the scenes before the curtain rises. 
                    You will also hear about the architecture and art of the Opera, about stage technique, opera and ballet.

                <h2>Deichman bjørvika Library</h2>
                <p>Deichman bjørvika library is Norway's largest public library in the country. 
                    Deichman is the main library, it has 18 branches and several special departments. 
                    It is very close to the Opera House. The library is open 7 days a week, at 08 - 22 weekdays and at 10 - 18 on weekends. 
                    I recommend you take the trip to Bjørvika. There are a lot of exciting things going on. 
                    Feel free to bring friends, your children or the whole family with you.

                <h2>Aker Brygge</h2>
                <p>In Aker Brygge you can get the great dining experiences, shopping and nice places to sit in front of the sea. 
                    All the restaurants located there have nice large outdoor seating. 
                    Here you can benefit from delicious food and drinks in the open air. 
                    And you will find galleries and art installations in a row, 
                    and not least the Astrup Fearnley Museum, at the far end of the fjord with its large sculpture park and beach.
                    summer times are the best times you can visit here because then you can swim, 
                     enjoy the weather without feeling cold.
