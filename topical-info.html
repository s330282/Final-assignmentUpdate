                    <p class="paragraph">New jobs have emerged every single year and replaced traditional jobs as long as we humans have been in work. Before, almost all products were made by hand, while after the industrial revolution, machines became the new “worker”. Almost everything we humans consume today is made by a machine. If a product is handmade today, then it will be marked on the packaging as “handmade”, simply because it is rare and testifies to higher quality.</p><br>

                    <p class="paragraph">Examples of outdated professions are (at least in the western part of the world):</p>
                    <h3><a class="wikilink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_delivery">Milkmen</a><br></h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">In a time when a lack of good refrigeration meant that milk would quickly spoil, milk was delivered to houses daily by milkmen.</p>

                    <h3><a class="wikilink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsetter">Pinsetter</a><br></h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Generally a job reserved for teenagers, the lowly paid bowling pinsetter job was the norm before automated pinsetters were introduced in the 1950s.</p>

                    <h3><a class="wikilink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamplighter">Lamplighter</a><br></h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Without electricity we would probably still be lighting up lamps in the street by hand.</p>

                    <h3><a class="wikilink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat-catcher">Ratcatcher</a><br></h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">The job of rat catcher was vital to keeping rat populations under control in Europe to prevent food damage and the spread of disease. Today we have more effective ways.</p>
                    
                    <p class="paragraph">Predicting the future is difficult, but we envisage that most of the new jobs that emerge are within technology and sustainability. Within data, there are probably many new professions that will emerge in the years to come. If we look at it very freely, it may be that artificial intelligence has come so far that we have robots that can feel such strong grief and pain, that they need their own type of doctor or psychologist. Perhaps a profession in the future will be called medical robot engineer or "robot psychologist". Instead of brand-new professions emerging, we can almost say with certainty that current professions will get an upgrade and new meaning with the help of technology. An example of this is that more and more stores now have self-service checkouts, which changes the job of cashiers from sitting in the checkout to rather keeping control of the self-service checkouts. Same, but different. We believe that monitoring automated processes so they run smoothly will be a big part of many professions in the future. This way, the current jobs are continued, but the work can be focused more on real value creation.</p>
